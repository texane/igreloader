serial to CAN bridge.

the device is put into listenall mode.

it forwards whatever packet is receives on the
serial endpoint to the CAN bus. The CAN message
id is the first byte of the serial frame. The
remaining buffer is CAN payload.

it forwards every frame got on the CAN link to
the serial endpoint by appending the CAN ID to
the serial frame, as explained above.
